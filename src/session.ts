/**
 * One session and one buffer per destination, for the life of the process.
 *
 * The first version made both inside `watch()`, which is right for a stdio
 * server — one process, one `watch()`, one session — and wrong for an HTTP one.
 * A streamable-HTTP server builds a fresh `McpServer` per request, so `watch()`
 * runs per request too, and every tool call became a session of its own.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic difference. Retries are found by looking for the same
 * tool twice inside one session, and first-call success is defined as no retry
 * following. With one call per session there can never be a retry, so the
 * server reports a perfect score however badly it is doing — the one number
 * this product exists to tell the truth about.
 *
 * Keyed by endpoint and key rather than a bare singleton: two watched servers
 * reporting to different MCPs in one process are two different streams, and
 * merging them would file one customer's calls under another's.

   * for HTTP exactly as the session did: `initialize` is handled by one
   * `McpServer` instance and `tools/call` by the next one, so the call never
   * saw the name and every event was filed as "unknown".
   *
   * It follows the session's model rather than the transport's: one value per
   * process per destination, last identification wins. For a server with two
   * concurrent clients that is an approximation — but it is the same
   * approximation the shared session already makes, and a name that is
   * occasionally the other client's beats a column that is always "unknown".
